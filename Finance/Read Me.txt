This file is still a work in progress. The end goal is to 
have a set of code that allows me to input a stock's name 
and return crtitical information pulled from Yahoo Finance 
and what percentage of my portfolio should be dedicated to 
that stock given my current portfolio and diversification 
criteria I set.
