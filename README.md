# Work-Sample

Both sets of code require a trackman data file to operate. The “Postgame Code” was built using the trackman file provided after each Alabama Baseball Game/Scrimmage. The “Heat Map Code” was built using a trackman file provided by the San Francisco Giants. Since both of those csv files contain valuable information, I am unable to post them with the code.
