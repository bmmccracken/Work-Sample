This code is designed to take a players:
name, start date, and end date

The goal of this code is to provide a focused
look at a players performance in a given time
period using statcast data. While statcast does
provide a lot of this information already, I 
thought it would be good practice using:
 - baseball_scraper
 - command line style functions
 - baseball visualiztion
