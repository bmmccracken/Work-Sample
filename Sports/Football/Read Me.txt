Still a work in progress. I wanted to play around
with pulling play-by-play data from ESPN and create
a postgame evaluation to work on my data collection
and data visualization in python.

Note: I may have this code collect and clean the data
and then feed it to Tableau, where I am more confident
in my visualization skills.
