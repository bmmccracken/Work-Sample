These are samples of work I have done 
with the Alabama Baseball Team. All of
the IPYNB files require a Trackman file
to use. Due to the sensitivity of the data
I will not provide a file to test with at
this time, but am looking to adapt these versions
of the code to statcast data for you to see the
end product of the code.
